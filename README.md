# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains an assignment focused on using a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from images. This project is part of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization and covers neural network design, implementation, and evaluation for multiclass classification.

## Contents
- `C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the assignment implementation and exercises.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Description
In this assignment, you will:
- Implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
- Apply ReLU activation and softmax functions.
- Use TensorFlow to build, train, and evaluate the neural network model.
- Work with a dataset of 5000 handwritten digit images.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/regmibhuwan/handwritten-digit-recognition.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   
  cd handwritten-digit-recognition

3. **Install the Dependencies**:
   
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
